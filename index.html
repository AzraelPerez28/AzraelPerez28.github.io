Here’s your favorite peony,
inspired by one who adores them—
the way I adore you.

        The peony wakes with the morning light,
petals unfurling, slow and bright.
Soft as a whisper, bold as a flame,
opening gently, yet never the same.

        The wind hums low; the garden sways,
time moves forward, yet love remains.
Like roots that hold through storm and rain,
we bloom, we bend, we rise again.

let them not speak of love’s decay,
but of a promise, full and true—
each bloom returning, just like you.

where peonies bloom and seasons sigh.
Love is not a fleeting thing,
but petals soft—awakening.
